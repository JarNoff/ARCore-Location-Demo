# ARCore-Location-Demo

Currently, there are random coordinates hardcoded into the location activity. In order to show the hank hill AR item, the user must change these coordinates to be within 0.00005 degrees of their current lcoation. 

This is kind of a junky way to handle the ARCore-Location library (From here: https://github.com/appoly/ARCore-Location) not working as it should. 

But I think the lighting, sizing, and positioning functions will be valuable to us.
